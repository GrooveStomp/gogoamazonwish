# GoGo Amazon Wish

A Go library to get items from an Amazon wishlist. Unofficial as Amazon
shut down their wishlist API. This uses web scraping to get the items
off a specified wishlist.

## How to develop

I built this with Go version 1.13.4. There's a command-line tool to test
loading an Amazon wishlist that you can run via:

`go run cmd/getwishlist/main.go` _URL to Amazon wishlist_ _[proxy URL]..._

You can specify optional proxy URLs to hit Amazon with. Might be useful if you're
hitting errors about Amazon thinking the tool is a bot.

Sample use:

```sh
go run cmd/getwishlist/main.go "https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3I6EQPZ8OB1DT"
```

To run tests: `make`
